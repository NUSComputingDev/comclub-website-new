                    and

            <p id="tab-para"><u>Faculty Matters</u>
            <p id="tab-para">Computing Club represents all the Computing Undergraduates and is their voice.
                The President is not only in charge of club happenings, but also various things in the faculty. This
                includes:
            </p>
            <ul id="tab-list">
                <li>Constant interaction with the student body (speeches, email blasts, etc.) to understand any concerns
                    or issues they may be facing and
                    bringing these up to the relevant offices in the school.</li>
                <li>Working with the School Leaders (Dean & Vice Deans) to address these issues and consider ways to
                    make
                    the life of every student better.</li>
                <li>Working with various offices in the University (OSA, OFN, OCA, etc.) to address any university level
                    issues. For example, I had to speak with the Office of Campus Amenities (OCA) to think of ways to
                    retain Cool
                    Spot in COM2 when their initial plan was to have it removed upon the opening of COM3.</li>
                <li>Participating in NUSSU meetings and discussions and representing the faculty and club in these
                    decision making processes.</li>
            </ul>

            <h1 id="tab-header">Experience</h1>
            <p id="tab-para">
                It was a very new and enriching experience. As the president, you have the birds eye view of the entire
                club. You get to see exactly how every member in the club is working and how the various cells are
                working together to support the club and faculty. <br><br>

                I went in thinking I'm the President of the Club and my job is to oversee the Club happenings. But very
                soon after taking over, I realised that the job is more than that. I also need to oversee all faculty
                happenings as well. <br><br>

                When being in charge of such a large institution, a lot of things get directed at you and lots of
                unexpected things will pop up. As a President, you need to stay strong and handle all of these issues
                calmly and efficiently. From my personal experience, this is only possible if you are confident about
                your team. So one learning point is that keeping the entire team strong and united is extremely
                crucial.<br><br>

                One of my favourite memories is at the very start of our term. When everyone was fresh and super
                motivated to embark on this journey. Seeing everyones energy and the big plans they had for SoC made me
                really excited as well. So glad the team was able to maintain the energy all the way and deliver
                everything they promised!<br><br>

                <br><br>

                As the general secretaries of the club, we work closely with members of the presidential wing to
                facilitate the overall operation and conduct of the Computing Club Management Committee and take charge
                of all club records responsibly. ðŸ“– Additionally, we also seek to look after the wellbeing of our
                members and promote bonding between all members of the Management Committee. ðŸ’ƒðŸ•º

                cohesions, birthday celebrations, welfare packs and customized gifts as a token of appreciation for the
                efforts put in by our members. During the monthly club meetings and milestone presentations, we would
                design bonding games and prepare refreshment for members to recharge in between serious conversations.
                <br><br>
                Given the nature of our work, we are able to build meaningful relationships not just between us and the
                rest of the club, but also between members from different cells.
                <br><br>
                The friendships we make and build here are the ones that will continue to stay dear to our hearts even
