                At our university, student life is not just a chapter, it's the essence of our journey. We're more than
                just learners; we're creators of memories and champions of lifelong friendships. Computing Club has
                enriched my student life, proving that we're not just dull techies, but vibrant souls with passions
                beyond codes.
                <br>
                <br>
                Today, we stand at a pivotal moment. Embrace the need for inclusivity, reflecting the tapestry of our
                diverse student body. Let's break the shackles of stereotypes, proving that we're anything but boring.
                Run for the 26th Management Committee Elections, and let's defy stereotypes together!

                As Elections Officer for this year's Management Committee, I am honoured to spearhead the process of
                appointing our next team of leaders. This election marks both the end of one chapter and the exciting
                beginning of a new one for Computing Club. With the progressive increase in the number of students
                putting forth their candidacies year-on-year, my hope is that the service and dedication of the 25th
                Management Committee has inspired even more fellow students to be the voice of their student body, and
                play their part in this year’s elections. For those of you who choose not to run for candidacy, I urge
                you all to remain actively involved - from coming down to support your nominees’ live campaign speeches,
                to casting your votes on election polling day. Your voices and engagement will be the guiding forces as
                we collectively navigate this thrilling new phase of Computing Club's journey. Together, let’s chart the
                course for our student life in the upcoming academic year!
