                Whether it be sourcing for sponsors for our events, or forging partnerships and collaborations with
                external organisations, we will be the ones who will strengthen and maintain our relationships with

                skills, something we do not normally get the chance to do as computing students, and network with all
                sorts of different companies.

                Merchandise - As part of the marketing cell, it was fun to brainstorm and see what kind of wacky ideas
                and designs we could come up with. Being in this cell really got our creative juices flowing and was a
                breath of fresh air from all the coding.

                Photoshop and Canva are our best friends, and we get the opportunity to hone our designing, branding,
                and communication skills! Working remotely helps with our time management, but we also hold
                brainstorming sessions to help get the creative juices flow.
