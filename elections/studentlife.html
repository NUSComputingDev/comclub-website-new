            Student Life is the largest and most active Wing in Comp Club, where we plan and organise events that shape
            the Computing experience - from Freshmen's first impression of SoC to the Alumni's point of contact
            post-graduation.
            <br><br>
            Our events include Freshmen Orientation Projects and Student Engagement. Beyond events and activities, we
            take care of the shared Student Lounge and strive to promote active communication between Comp Club and the
            student body.
            <br><br>
            Ultimately, we aspire to bring the SoC community together and help forge everlasting
            friendships.

            <h1 id="tab-header">Experience</h1>
            <p id="tab-para">
                The Student Life Wing is in charge of some of the biggest events in SoC, including Orientation Camps
                and BASH. As part of this Wing, you could anticipate being involved in fun and engaging events, making
                many new friends and memories along the way. However, it is not to say that my experience as VP(SL)
                was stress-free. While there are challenging times to go through, at the end of the day, it is really
                heartening to see participants enjoying themselves during the events, and to see events involving over
                600 people come to fruition.
                <br><br>

                As VP(SL), there is a huge responsibility in ensuring that the events are safe and inclusive. At the
                same time, the Directors and Project Directors will also be facing pressure during busy periods of
                time. It is then the role of a VP to ensure that your Directors and Project Directors, as well as OComm
                members, are well supported in terms of manpower, and are given sufficient rest.<br><br>

                I am thankful to have the most passionate and involved team of Directors and Project Directors working
                alongside me. Each one of them cared deeply for the welfare of the students and in planning the events,
                they would always have the participantsâ€™ best interests at heart. We would recount our experience from
                previous years and aim to organise events better than the last. Without the Directors and Project
                Directors, the events would not have run smoothly and many goals would not have been made possible.
                <br><br>

                Being part of a Club with so many different Wings and Cells of various functions, as well as being in
                charge of various events, the key takeaway for me would be communication. A slight miscommunication
                could cause a lot of issues along the way. If some things do not work out as expected, it is best to
                be honest with the other VPs and your Directors. Since this is a collective effort, you should not be
                dealing with things alone, and if you need help, always reach out to the rest of the Club.
                That being said, it is good to maintain a cordial relationship with everyone you are working with.
                Help other Wings as much as you can, while also keeping in mind the capacity of yourself and your
                Directors.<br><br>

                To the next VP(SL): Do not let the fun fool you! It can get pretty tough taking on this role, or being
                in this Wing at all. However, you can expect to grow a lot as a leader, learning to care for the welfare
                of the people in your Wing, and most importantly, making some of the best memories you could have in SoC!

                As part of the FOP cell, we organise 4 events! FSC, FOW, FFC and BASH. Every year this lineup of
                events will be decided by the FOP cell, if you are looking to organise additional events feel free
                to come up with a proposal for approval!

                The FOP cell is responsible for the recruitment of PDs for the respective events and liaison with
                Computing Club and the advisors.
                <br><br>
                Apart from the management committee and advisors, we work closely with many students, recruiting close
                to 300 student OGLs and committee members, forming the largest cell in Computing Club. Hence,
                you will get to meet friends from every major.
                <br><br>
                Workload wise, the FOP cell gets the busiest during our summer break closer to when the incoming batch
                of freshies come in. From testing games to packing logistics, summer will definitely be fun filled for
                the FOP cell :) However, this doesn't mean that your semesters are untouched too, although more chill,
                there will still be periods where planning early is essential.
                <br><br>
                We have definitely learnt a lot during our year in Computing Club, working with new people is definitely
                not an easy task, but with an open mind and willingness to try, it will definitely be a fruitful
                experience in FOP cell!

                Working as a director in the club's leadership team allowed me to collaborate closely with other
                directors. Together, we had to plan events, manage timelines, and ensure seamless execution. This
                exposure to event planning and cross-functional collaboration became a catalyst for honing my teamwork
                skills. Learning to communicate effectively, delegate tasks, and adapt to different working styles has
                been instrumental in our collective success. <br><br>

                As directors, we interacted not only with club members but also with faculty advisors, school
                administrators, and external partners. Understanding the diverse perspectives and needs of these
                stakeholders proved vital in making informed decisions. Through active listening and empathy, I
                learned how to navigate various viewpoints and achieve alignment on common goals. <br><br>

                Being part of a club with limited resources taught me how to optimize what we had at our disposal.
                Whether it was budgeting for events or efficiently allocating time and talent, I developed a keen sense
                of resource management. Embracing constraints fueled creativity and allowed us to maximize our impact
                despite limited resources. <br><br>

                In conclusion, the Computing Club has been a transformative learning journey, empowering me with
                essential skills in stakeholder management, resource management, and most notably, effective teamwork.
                Through event planning with fellow directors, I embraced collaboration and improved my ability to
                navigate diverse perspectives. As I carry these invaluable experiences forward, I am confident in my
                capacity to succeed in future endeavours, armed with a solid foundation in these critical skills.
