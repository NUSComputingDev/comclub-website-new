            Student Life is the largest and most active Wing in Comp Club, where we plan and organise events that shape
            the Computing experience - from Freshmen's first impression of SoC to the Alumni's point of contact
            post-graduation.
            <br><br>
            Our events include Freshmen Orientation Projects and Student Engagement. Beyond events and activities, we
            take care of the shared Student Lounge and strive to promote active communication between Comp Club and the
            student body.
            <br><br>
            Ultimately, we aspire to bring the SoC community together and help forge everlasting
            friendships.

            <h1 id="tab-header">Experience</h1>
            <p id="tab-para">
                For me, the experience was exciting and meaningful. As the leader of the largest sub-committee in the
                club, I was engaged in Com Club matters consistently throughout the year, engaging with different OComms
                from recruitment, and proposal planning all the way to execution and post-event reflection.
                <br><br>

                I also focused on ensuring my wing are bonded and helpful with each other throughout the year. This was
                achieved by our multiple gatherings and outings beyond our meeting time! This allows us to be closer
                with each other, which is crucial during our busy periods. <br><br>

                At each of the events, I always attended alongside the project directors to help oversee the operations
                of the events, while helping out with administrative matters or emergency situations. For example, I was
                staying with the OComm for FOW throughout 4 days of the camp to ensure the team were fine and not
                overwhelmed by the scale of this physical camp.<br><br>

                Being an international student, I also guided my wing to focus on inclusivity and fairness to all
                students in SoC, regardless of race, gender or nationality. This has allowed us to have diversity and
                representation in our events and allowing SoC students to form new friendships with others through our
                events like COMaraderie and Meliorium.<br><br>

                Overall, I am grateful to have completed my responsibility as an VP(SL) and I have definitely grown a lot
                with my leadership and management skills. To the potential candidates: It is going to be a tough and
                tiring journey to lead and serve - but the joy and satisfaction will come when you know the impact our
                events and our camps have had on every student experience in SoC.<br><br>

                As part of the FOP cell, we organise 5 events! FSC, EFOP, FOW, RAG & BASH. Every year this lineup of
                events will be decided by the FOP cell, if you are looking to organise additional events feel free to
                come up with a proposal for approval!

            <p id="tab-para">
                The FOP cell is responsible for the recruitment of PDs for the respective events and liaison with
                Computing Club and the advisors.
                <br><br>
                Apart from the management committee and advisors, we work closely with many students, recruiting close
                to
                300 student OGLs and committee members, forming the largest cell in Computing Club. Hence, you will get
                to meet friends from every major.
                <br><br>
                Workload wise, the FOP cell gets the busiest during our summer break closer to when the incoming batch
                of freshies come in. From testing games to packing logistics, summer will definitely be fun filled for
                the FOP cell :) However, this doesn't mean that your semesters are untouched too, although more chill,
                there will still be periods where planning early is essential.
                <br><br>
                We have definitely learnt a lot during our year in Computing Club, working with new people is definitely
                not an easy task, but with an open mind and willingness to try, it will definitely be a fruitful
                experience in FOP cell!
