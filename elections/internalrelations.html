            Internal Relations is the People's Wing. <br>
            As the name suggests, our wing involves in fundamental student affairs, and addresses their problems,
            requirements and challenges. We seek to be the Wing that connects the closest to the student body. We strive
            at every action and step we do, to plan and organise initiatives with the students' needs in mind.
            <br><br>
            Under Internal Relations are the Welfare and Sports Cells; both of which are the pillars of a student's
            well-being, their mental well-being (Welfare) as well as their physical well-being (Sports). By targeting
            both aspects and providing good balance between both, we hope to ensure that every SOC student,
            Needs are met, Problems are addressed, Challenges are tackled and thus feel understood.

            <h1 id="tab-header">Experience</h1>
            <p id="tab-para">I would say the role of VP(IR) requires a lot of independence and creativity. It's always a
                question of: With the budget, resources and manpower I have currently, what's the best way to improve
                and better the lives of Computing Students? Every VP(IR) can have a different way to approach this, but
                the only one true metric to measure our success is the satisfaction of the students.</p>

            <img src="../assets/elections/internal_relations/vp_2.jpg" alt="" id="tab-img-dup">
            <p id="tab-para">
                What I realize as VP(IR) is in order to succeed, it's crucial for you to really understand all and every
                Computing student. So if you have not already, get to know and talk to every Computing student you meet
                and listen to their troubles and gather their feedback!
                <br><br>

                As VP(IR) we set up the foundation to better the lives of Computing students, and let the Directors
                build
                it from the foundation up. And it is a reality that you will not always be recognised for the work you
                do behind the scenes. But for me, and hopefully for you too, the thought that I have the power to make
                one of my faculty mate's day a little bit brighter, nicer and happier is what drives me to put in 100%
                and push for initiatives that continue to better the lives of my faculty mates.<br><br>

                We started off the journey not knowing what to expect, and we got to learn a lot along the way. One

                rewarding and memorable experience.
                <br><br>
                One important lesson we learnt was the importance of communication
                between us and our various stakeholders, such as our PDs and the Computing students, as it serves as the
                primary feedback loop through which we were able to further refine our events to cater to the needs of

                hosted E-Sports Night. With the high vaccination rate in NUS, E-Sports Night provides an opportunity for
                the students of SoC to get together physically and learn from each other through games.

                Building on from last year, we decided to host Valorant & League of Legends and hopefully attract more
