            <h1 id="tab-header">Experience</h1>
            <p id="tab-para">
                As VP(SD), my journey has been immensely fulfilling, as I had the privilege to actively contribute to
                the all-rounded education of students at the School of Computing while highlighting the significance of
                community engagement. One of the most transformative aspects of my tenure was the opportunity to
                interact and collaborate with a diverse array of stakeholders. From students and faculty to staff and
                community partners, each interaction enriched my understanding of various perspectives and needs.
                Engaging with these stakeholders not only allowed me to implement impactful initiatives but also
                broadened my own horizons. It was a journey of learning and growth, as I discovered the power of
                effective communication and the art of building strong relationships.<br><br>

                As I faced challenges and navigated through various situations, I observed my personal growth take
                shape. Maturity became a natural byproduct of my experiences, and my confidence in my leadership
                abilities soared. I discovered the value of resilience and adaptability, traits that proved invaluable
                in managing diverse teams and tackling complex problems. <br><br>

                Moreover, the role of VP(SD) has taught me the importance of staying true to my vision while being open
                to feedback and collaboration. Embracing different perspectives and ideas allowed me to refine my
                initiatives, making them more effective and inclusive. My time as VP(SD) has instilled in me a lifelong
                commitment to personal and professional development.

                It’s definitely been an eventful and memorable journey. Working with my fellow peers in Computing
                Club has been a great experience and contributing back to my faculty has been extremely meaningful to
                me. Throughout, I had my fair share of fun and work, made new friends and I am glad to have had this

                My journey within has been nothing short of fruitful. Throughout my time in Computing Club, I had the
                opportunity to make many new friends, from my peers in Computing Club to students in School of
                Computing. I’m also glad to see the students of the School of Computing come together and participate in
                our events. It was very heartwarming to see how the work we have done has positively impacted the
                student body.

                speakers including NCS, TikTok, P&G, Creddit Suisse and NUS Overseas Colleges. The event hosted over
                400 participants that spanned across 3 days. Throughout, students were able to learn what it was like

                Winter Workshop is a long running tradition that helped freshmen ease into their university curriculum.
                This year, we conducted workshops for java, CS2040S & CS2030S. Students were able to get a headstart
                into these curriculum before the heavy semester began, which allowed them to have a smoother sailing
                semester ahead.

                make it our flagship event in the coming years. Through a 10 week long summer course, students were
                able to get their hands on Software Engineering Practices as a team. Teams were required to develop a
                software application and were given mentorship by the senior mentors.

                A goal of this year was to have a bigger outreach to the student body, providing them with opportunities
                to participate in hackathons, Industry talks and company events. As such, we started this initiative of
                communicating such opportunities to the student body through our new instagram account, soc.acads.
                This initiative was an overwhelming success, having gained 450 followers in the academic year and we
                plan to continue this initiative in upcoming years.

            <h1 id="tab-header">Introduction</h1>
            <p id="tab-para">The Rag and Flag cell, like its name suggests, is in charge of organising both
                Receiving and Giving (RAG) and Flag events, both of which are NUS-organised annual charity projects.
                <br><br>
                Flag is a year-long fundraising event where our committee organises events where we sell merchandise,
                engage beneficiaries in person, or even take to the streets to raise funds for the beneficiary we
                are partnered with, which is MINDS Fernvale Gardens, a school which caters to the needs of the
                intellectually disabled.
                <br><br>
                Rag is intertwined with Flag, in the sense that it is an event which is designed to give back to the
                donors which supported Flag, and is designed to accomplish this by putting up a stunning performance
                at UTown Green, accompanied by floats and dancers, which are dressed in tailor-made costumes.
                <br><br>
                If you want to be a part of one of NUS’ flagship orientation programmes, as well as to make a difference
                in the lives of both our beneficiaries and freshmen, the Rag and Flag cell provides an excellent
                means to do so.

            <h1 id="tab-header">Roles</h1>

                for freshmen doing so.<br><br>
                As Rag and Flag director, you would have to recruit suitable project directors and subcommittee members
                for both Rag and Flag, managing both events on a larger scale, such as deconflicting events with other

            <p id="tab-para">My Computing Club journey has contributed immensely to my personal growth. From having to
                resolve interpersonal conflicts, building up the confidence to lead, pushing myself out of my comfort
                zone to network with others and working under time pressure, it might not immediately be obvious why
                people would take up this role. However, I would argue that it really built up my capacity to lead and
                gave me plenty of leadership experience, given the fact that I have not had the chance to lead in such a manner before.
