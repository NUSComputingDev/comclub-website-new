            education at School of Computing, the Student Dev Wing is something you should definitely consider.
            This year, we introduced 2 major initiatives (SoCollab & Wikithon) - to offer an exciting platform for
            students to deepen their knowledge about social and academic matters!

                These cells are filled with exciting events that ultimately allow School of Computing students to

                making sure all decisions that the faculty makes are in the best interest of the student body. While the
                VP is more involved in the planning process, the Directors play a supporting role in ensuring that these
                plans are realistic, executable and deliverable.
                <br><br>As VP(SD), you would be supporting your cell's events and planning for any new initiatives

            <p id="tab-para">
                My experience as VP(SD) has definitely been extremely meaningful because I had the chance to play a part
                in allowing students to achieve an all rounded education at School of Computing - at the same time
                educating them on the importance of community engagement.<br><br>

                Throughout my term, I communicated with a myriad of stakeholders, only to see myself become more mature
                and confident. I saw myself become a more robust leader who is not afraid of bringing out initiatives or
                planning for change. I became more decisive and gained significant experience in time management and
                multitasking. <br><br>

                Overall, I have certainly made lifelong bonds and created precious memories - I will always look back
                at them.
                Computing Club has gifted me with some of the closest friends and I am forever thankful to have started
                on this journey back in Year 1!

                It also hosts Academic events to allow students to explore new avenues and better formulate their
                academic interests. We have 4 main events, Career Launchpad meant to provide students with informative
                talks and webinars from external organizations, Lifehack which is an annual hackathon hosted by NUS
                Computing club, Mock Practicals which helps students prepare for their practical exams and lastly Winter
                workshop which provides workshops to students for higher level modules.
                <br><br>
                We will go beyond to provide students with all the opportunities in honing their technical skills and
                being ever ready for a career in today's transformative tech industry.

                <em>[David, Director]:</em><br>
                Fulfilling and memorable would be two words that I would use to describe my journey in Computing Club. I
                have learnt how to see and plan things on a macro scale and most importantly, learnt how to work
                together as a team and clearly communicate my ideas to get the message across. Plenty of get-together
                sessions really made journey very much more memorable. Favorite memory would definitely have to be our
                each and every cohesion. Work hard, play hard!
                <br><br>
                <em>[Joel, Deputy Director]:</em><br>
                My Experience has been great so far. I made many friends through Computing Club as well as through
                interacting with many of my peers through the events we held. The biggest takeaway is definitely being
                able to work with other computing students and helping them in any way we can. It is a responsibility
                that may not have any tangible benefits but the friends I made and the impact of what we do makes it
                worth it.
