            The Presidential Wing (P Wing) consists of the President, the General Secretaries, Finance Secretary,
            Operations Secretary, Tech Leads & the 4 Vice Presidents. In contrast to its grandiose title,
            the Presidential Wing seeks to handle all internal club affairs to ensure its other wings are able to run
            smoothly. Beyond that, the Presidential Wing seeks to be a force multiplier, bolstering the capabilities
            of the other wings, ensuring that these 4 Wings are all working together and are all on track.
            "The mitochondria is the powerhouse of the cell", similar to the mitochondria, we seek to power all
            Computing Club events by providing the necessary support.
            <br><br>
            We have weekly meetings to get updates on all the cells, and identify areas for collaboration between the
            different cells. The Vice Presidents also get feedback from the rest of the P Wing to improve upon their
            events.

            <p id="tab-para">Computing Club represents all the Computing Undergraduates and is their voice.
                The President is not only in charge of club happenings, but also various things in the faculty. This
                includes:
            </p>
            <ul id="tab-list">
                <li>Constant interaction with the student body (speeches, email blasts, etc.) to understand any concerns
                    or issues they may be facing and
                    bringing these up to the relevant offices in the school.</li>

                    the life of every student better.</li>
                <li>Working with various offices in the University (OSA, OFN, OCA, etc.) to address any university level
                    issues. For example, I had to speak with the Office of Campus Amenities (OCA) to think of ways to
                    retain Cool
                    Spot in COM2 when their initial plan was to have it removed upon the opening of COM3.</li>

                    decision making processes.</li>
            </ul>

            <h1 id="tab-header">Experience</h1>
            <p id="tab-para">
                It was a very new and enriching experience. As the president, you have the birds eye view of the entire
                club. You get to see exactly how every member in the club is working and how the various cells are
                working together to support the club and faculty. <br><br>

                I went in thinking I'm the President of the Club and my job is to oversee the Club happenings. But very
                soon after taking over, I realised that the job is more than that. I also need to oversee all faculty
                happenings as well. <br><br>

                When being in charge of such a large institution, a lot of things get directed at you and lots of
                unexpected things will pop up. As a President, you need to stay strong and handle all of these issues
                calmly and efficiently. From my personal experience, this is only possible if you are confident about
                your team. So one learning point is that keeping the entire team strong and united is extremely
                crucial.<br><br>

                One of my favourite memories is at the very start of our term. When everyone was fresh and super
                motivated to embark on this journey. Seeing everyones energy and the big plans they had for SoC made me
                really excited as well. So glad the team was able to maintain the energy all the way and deliver
                everything they promised!<br><br>

            <p id="tab-para">Welcome to the Computing Club Management Committee! Our vision is to create a
                well-organised and tightly-knit committee, where club records are managed responsibly and all members

                camaraderie and mutual support among our members.
                <br><br>
                As the General Secretaries of the club, we work hand in hand with the Presidential Wing to
                ensure the smooth functioning of the Computing Club Management Committee. Our primary responsibility
                is to take charge of all club records and administrative tasks, but we go beyond that to look
                after the wellbeing of our members and promote bonding among everyone involved.
            </p>

            <h1 id="tab-header">Roles</h1>
            <p id="tab-para">Our roles as General Secretaries are diverse and multifaceted. We are entrusted with the
                vital task of maintaining various administrative aspects of the Computing Club. This includes managing
                the club's Telegram Channel, disseminating important information through the weekly faculty newsletter,
                handling locker applications, and organizing club meetings. In addition to these administrative
                responsibilities, we also take on the crucial role of caring for the welfare of our club members.
                <br><br>
                We understand that a united and harmonious committee is the key to success, so we frequently organize
                bonding activities such as club-wide cohesions, birthday celebrations, and distribute welfare packs.
                <br><br>
                We believe in acknowledging and appreciating the efforts put in by our members, and thus we also
                prepare customized gifts as tokens of appreciation.

                responsibility. Managing administrative tasks and club records has taught us to be organized and
                detail-oriented, ensuring that everything runs smoothly. But beyond the administrative aspects,
                the true joy comes from witnessing the growth of our club members and the bonds that form among them.

                While being adept with numbers is beneficial, it is not the most crucial aspect of this role.
